[Export]
; Used by simpleExport.php and longExport.php 
; Format is CSV | TXT 
; BOM if present is inserted at start of exported files e.g. \ufeff
; NB exported data is UTF-8-encoded 
; NB BOM must be encoded in a JSON-fashion e.g. \ufeff rather than \xef\xbb\xbf
; (calling code will decode this ini file entry using json_decode)  
Format = CSV
BOM = \ufeff
; CountryCounts should be 1 to include a separate table of country counts below the main export table 
; or 0 to omit it 
; use 0 if you may need to filter or sort the table 
; and 1 if for convenience you want the two tables one above the other in the output 
CountryCounts = 1
