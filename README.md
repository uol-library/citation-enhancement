# Introduction 
To enhance the metadata in citations from reading lists in the Leganto system using data from various external systems. 

Initially one focus will be on collecting geographical affiliation of authors. 

The starting point for this is the software developed at Imperial College, London, to collect author information for journal articles from the WoS API Enhanced:

We plan to extend this with other material types and data sources. 

# Getting Started
TODO: Guide users through getting your code up and running on their own system. In this section you can talk about:
1.	Installation process
2.	Software dependencies
3.	Latest releases
4.	API references

# Build and Test
TODO: Describe and show how to build your code and run the tests. 

# Contribute
TODO: Explain how other users and developers can contribute to make your code better.
