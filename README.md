# Introduction 
To enhance the metadata in citations from reading lists in the Leganto system using data from various external systems. 
Initially one focus will be on collecting geographical affiliation of authors. 
The starting point for this is the software developed at Imperial College, London, to collect author information for journal articles from the WoS API Enhanced:

We plan to extend this with other material types and data sources. 

# Getting Started

# Build and Test
TODO: Describe and show how to build your code and run the tests. 

# Contribute
